# summer2015

mimicking a bank system.
i have a restful api (jersey-jax rs) connected to a mongodb database.
i have a webapp, a native android app, and a javaclient so i can do things from a command prompt.
did this as a test for an internship i abandoned last summer.

a user can log-in , add accounts remove accounts add $$ to accounts, withdraw $$ from accounts, transfer $$ between accounts.
